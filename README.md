# Our Purpose behind this project :smiley:

So, basically the idea is that thousands of developers/students/tech enthusiasts will share their journey about anything they have achieved and done in their carrier so that the newbies can learn from their experiences and avoid those mistakes which they have done. So, Feel free to share with us ðŸ™‚

The second idea is you will never find a place where you will get thousands of experiences and journies of people who are doing so much in their carrier and have achieved so much . There is a way that you can listen to podcasts, but that is very limited for you.you don't know everyone. And listening to podcasts is also very time consuming, but reading documentation is NOT .
